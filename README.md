# LengthAPS
---

A Python 3.x snippet to calculate the length of APS Journals' manuscripts formatted in $\LaTeX$ following [APS guidelines](http://journals.aps.org/authors/length-guide).

This code is based on [aps-length](https://github.com/jameskermode/aps-length) by James Kermode using [wordcount.tex](http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/wordcount) by Michael J. Downes.
